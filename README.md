# BIT_Lev7sdv_gameshop
This commit is the assignment completed for the Level 7 Software Development paper that I completed as part of the Bachelor of Information Technology @ NMIT.
The app code is not absolutely finished, but I was able to acheive a A- in its current state of completion.
For the app to be able to access and change data, please run GameSelfHost.exe ( BIT_Lev7sdv_gameshop/GameService/bin/Debug/GameSelfHost.exe )

If the gameSelfHost file does not run, you will need to insert the pathway contained 
  (AttachDbFilename = <!--YOUR PATHWAY--> ;)
  in  BIT_Lev7sdv_gameshop/GameService/App.config to the directory you clone to.
